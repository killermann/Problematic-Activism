You'll start getting emails at whatever pace you selected (one per post, a summary of that week, or an occasional one when there's big news). If you ever want to change the pace, just reply to one of the emails and ask.

Speaking of replies, anything you send back will go directly to me, [Sam Killermann](https://www.samkillermann.com), the author in these here parts.

Consider this your open invitation to tap that curvy arrow and let me know what you think!

Looking forward to hearing from you,
