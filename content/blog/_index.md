description: 'A topical blog about social justice activism gone wrong — from "wokeism" to "cancel culture" to "social justice dogma" — and what we can do instead.'

Where the _Problematic Activism_ book is overarching -- not tied into a particular news cycle, but reflective of the trends that connect them, telling the story of a decade of activism and painting a picture of what the next decade might look like -- the blog is topical. **I'll slog through the news, venturing into the darkest corners of the internet, so you don't have to.**
